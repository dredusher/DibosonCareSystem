# DibosonCareSystem

The Diboson Care System was developed by Ed Usher following his experiences in caring for elderly 
relatives who wanted to remain in the comfort of their own homes. Before going any further it is 
worth mentioning that the term diboson does not relate to any caring task - it derives from the 
author's scientific past and means 'two bosons'; a boson is a class of elementary particle which 
includes the proton and its partner the antiproton - important players in the author's doctoral thesis.

Having got the scientific lesson out of the way it is important to say that in caring for his relatives, 
the author identified areas which could have been improved by the implementation of readily-available technology. 
With a long career in the information technology industry the author, in retirement, decided to design a single 
applicationÂ  which can provide facilities to enhance the quality of life for those people who require care in 
their own home. It is intended to provide an intuitive interface which will enable facilities to be accessed by 
the user touching the screen or by issuing voice commands.

For cost reasons development has been for Android devices and the intention is that the application will be 
provided for free.

It is also very important to note that many of the facilities will be accessed by the people who are providing 
the care rather than the person(s) receiving the care.

With any system of care, the main requirement is to ensure the safety and well-being of the person being looked after.

This application aims to do this in a number of ways.

It will try and aid in the correct administration of medication and take the appropriate actions if it feels that 
there is a problem. Through bluetooth technology it can ensure that a person does not wander too far away from a 
designated area and if they try and do so then appropriate action can be taken.

Sadly there are a number of instances where carers fail to carry out their duties or treat the user in a way 
that is unacceptable. If this is suspected then a family member can remotely dial any smartphone on the network and 
request that monitoring be switched on - this will cause voice and video recording to be started, without the user 
being aware. Should action need to be taken then the recordings could be used as evidence.

Clearly the application is under development by one person, there are obviously a number of other areas which need 
to be addressed but the priority at this stage is to finalise 'Phase 1' and to get some user feedback. Also it would
be good to get more developers with a wider range of experience.
