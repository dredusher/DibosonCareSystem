13/12/2015 ECU MedicationActivity get an 'index out of bounds' exception when a medication dose is actioned
 F I X E D ?   when the app is being restarted. No investigation has been performed - just added a try/catch
               and log the exception.
               27/03/2016 ECU a lot of changes were made to the handling of interrupts so that if one occurs
                              when the app is not running then it will be restarted automatically.
                          ECU TimerActivity - set of a 'tablet' reminder seems to work OK
                          ECU Setting a dose to occur when the app is not running does not automatically
                              cause the app to be restarted.
31/12/2015 ECU problem occurs when the Maplin bluetooth keyboard is switched on. Seems to activate the app
 F I X E D     in a strange, and unwanted, way. Suspect the issue is in the manifest or the ArduinoCommunicationService
               because I suspect the keyboard is being seen as a USB device. 
               04/01/2016 ECU problem arises because when the keyboard is switched on it generates a 'configuration 
               				  change' which will cause the activity to be restarted - changed to include 'keyboard' 
               				  in onConfigChanges in the manifest
08/06/2016 ECU AudioAnalyser - when this is declared as an 'extend DibosonActivity' then seems to be an issue with
               the BACK key and it appears that the activity is not terminating correctly and the whole app seems to
               'hang'. If change to 'extend Activity' then do not appear to have an issue. Added onBackPressed and
               returned to 'extend DibosonActivity' (also removed onKeyDown which was used used to detect BACK
               in old versions of android) but problem persisted until the 'super.onBackPressed' call was
               removed - have left it this way but still do not understand why.
 F I X E D ECU Further investigation (and looking on the internet) seems to imply that there are memory leak issues
               when an AsyncTask is run for a long time such that it continues running even after the activity
               has been 'finished' - see notes in AudioAnalyser.java
28/06/2016 ECU ShowEPGActivity - having put in the option to display a particular channel (or to show all) then
               testing shows that the logic works but occasionally the app is stopping with the following logged
               entry

               looks very much like a timing issue because it is happening randomly but at this stage not clear where the problem is.
               30/06/2016 ECU I thought the problem was to do with the display between refreshed after the DialogueUtilities dialogue
                              has been dismissed. Have put in this code to build a delay before finishing and then restarting the 
                              activity (using a handler) but even with a delay of 10 seconds the problem still persists
                          ECU in TVEPGFragment at the AdapterHandler when handling MESSAGE_FINISH then use
                          			this.removeMessages (StaticData.MESSAGE_SLEEP);
                          	   to delete any pending 'sleeps' - this seems to have improved the situation but still not sure.
                          ECU further investigation shows that the problem still persists but less frequently. There certainly
                              seems to be a window when the data is changing in size.
               02/07/2016 ECU Wonder if the problem is caused by the handler that exists in TVEPGFragment and is responsible for
                              causing a 'screen update' on a timed basis - this may be the 'window' which I suspect is causing
                              the problem because when the 'select channel' dialogue is started then want to stop updating
                              the display because the data set is being changed. Declared a variable in ShowEPGActivity called
                              'updateAdapter' so that the adapter is only updated in the variable is true. The variable is
                              set to 'false' when the dialogue starts. Unfortunately this seemed like a good idea but although
                              it seemed to reduce the number of times the problem occurred it did not solve the problem so removed
                              the 'updateAdapter' variable and the code relating to it.
               04/07/2016 ECU because TVChannelsSelected is a static variable then, when the ShowEPGAcrivity is restarted,
                              there is a window when it will retain the previous value until bein reset to the new value.
                              Therefore at the start of the activity then reset the variable to 'null. Initial tests seem to
                              show an improvement but am 'holding my breath' 
   F I X E D   05/07/2016 ECU since making the 04/07/2016 mod then have done a lot of testing and the problem has not surfaced.
                              MORAL - when using 'static' variables make sure that they are initialised correctly. 
               23/09/2016 ECU When starting the app then occasionally get

                              This seems to happen mainly when a new version of the app is downloaded from the PC and not
                              when the app is restarted on the device. Need to investigate but probably as a lower
                              priority. I believe the problem is to do with starting another activity from within MainActivity
                              - the StartUpActivity.  
                              
                              Further investigation seems to confirm that this only seems to occur on 'load from PC'
                              so not as important as first thought - but still need to understand.                 
               28/11/2016 ECU Problem with trying to set the speaker phone on when making a phone call on the Sony XA.
                              This is detailed in the Notes file.
               03/03/2017 ECU I M P O R T A N T
                              =================
                              If the app is started up normally and then selected again from 'home' or 'recent apps'
                              button then everything seems to work fine, but if :-
                                  1) set the 'restart app on alarm' bit to 'true'
                                  2) set up a 'timer alarm' to occur a little in the future (for tests always used a
                                     'timer alarm' to display a 'free text message'
                                  3) close the app and wait for the alarm to occur
                                  4) when the 'alarm' occurs it seems to be processed properly
                                  5) PROBLEM - everytime the app is started from 'home' then appear to get a new instance.
