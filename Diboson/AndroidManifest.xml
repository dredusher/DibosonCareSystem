		  29/11/2015 ECU 3.08.18 Put in cancel phone call as voice 
		                         command and alter server commands to
		                         process. All added commands into
		                         StaticData	
		  01/12/2015 ECU 3.08.19 Start to put 'alarm manager' handling
		                         into PanicAlarmActivity	
		  04/12/2015 ECU 3.08.20 Add 'shake' detection into the Panic
		                         Alarm activity	
		  05/12/2015 ECU 3.08.21 PanicAlarm - take out all the old code
		                         when checking was done via TimerService
		  11/12/2015 ECU 3.08.22 PanicAlarm - include the gForce, etc..
		                         in the object rather than being static.
		  14/12/2015 ECU 3.08.23 General tidy up of MedicationInput and
		                         alarms with use of fileChoice in
		                         DialogueUtilities. Generalised the
		                         screen capture.
		  17/12/2015 ECU 3.08.24 Lots of playing around with the
		   						 FileArrayAdapter because not working
		   						 in AlertDialog but is working from
		   						 FileChoose - see Notes	 
		  19/12/2015 ECU 3.08.25 Put in a new alarm that can have an
		  						 associated method definition. Tidy up
		  						 AppointmentsActivity, and associated
		  						 classes.
		  						 
		  						 Also changed the appointments activity
		  						 to use the selector mechanism.
		  21/12/2015 ECU 3.08.26 Tidy up the mechanism for prompts to
		                         ensure that the user takes action on the
		                         displayed options.
		  23/12/2015 ECU 3.08.27 Looked into issues with alarms which
		                         seemed to be happening before the app
		                         was in a position to process them (see
		                         Notes) - basically changed the DailyScheduler
		                         and AlarmManagerReceiver state to false
		                         and leave it to the app (in MainActivity)
		                         to enable them
		  24/12/2015 ECU 3.08.28 Added Utilities.SetAnExactAlarm which
		                         determines whether to use 'set' or
		                         'setExact' based on whether < KitKat
		                         or not. Changed all alarm setting calls
		                         to use this new method.
		  29/12/2015 ECU 3.08.29 Start to tidy up bluetooth discovery
		                         as part of the detection of a carer's
		                         visit. Changed to use alarm rather
		                         than a handler.
		  01/01/2016 ECU 3.08.30 Tried to tidy up the cancellation of
		  			 			 alarms.
		  03/01/2016 ECU 3.08.31 Some tidying up of the carer system
		                         which are recorded in the appropriate
		                         activities against this date.
		  04/01/2016 ECU 3.08.32 Added 'keyboard' to onConfigChanges
		                         because of issues when using a 
		                         bluetooth keyboard
		  06/01/2016 ECU 3.08.33 Lots of corrections to do with SMS and
		                         incoming server strings to process -
		                         all logged against this date
		  07/01/2016 ECU 3.08.34 Cloning to the HTC caused problems so
		                         modified the device details to include
		                         the API level and then use this to
		                         restrict the size of file to send -
		                         the size can be changed in settings
		  10/01/2016 ECU 3.08.35 Lots more tidying up with the file
		                         transfer task - mainly in 
		                         FileTransferUtilities
		  18/01/2016 ECU 3.08.36 Rearrange the FTP stuff to have 
		  						 separate control and data transfer
		  						 blocks - and test.
		  =============================================================
		  19/01/2016 ECU 4.00.00 At this point NO new software is to
		                         be developed other than to correct
		                         issues with existing code
		  20/01/2016 ECU 4.00.01 Changed the network discovery to obtain
		                         details from 'discovered' devices using
		                         the 'Devices' object rather than a
		                         text message which needed to be parsed
		  22/01/2016 ECU 4.00.02 Put in ActionCommandUtilities to help
		                         with the creation of individual action
		                         commands
		  31/01/2016 ECU 4.00.03 Lots of tidying up with the carer system
		  						 to take account of deleting items
		  						 which have related items.
		  06/02/2016 ECU 4.00.04 Care visit plan - change the order of
		  						 carer and agency and set a listener on
		  						 the carer spinner so that the agency
		  						 position can be changed
		  08/02/2016 ECU 4.00.05 LocationActivity - provide the option 
		                         to log the locations to a file (KML 
		                         format) so that it can be displayed
		                         by Google Earth
		  14/02/2016 ECU 4.00.06 MusicPlayer - changed to DibosonActivity
		                         because was having NPE on being
		                         restarted after being destroyed by the
		                         OS
		  19/02/2016 ECU 4.00.07 ShowEPGActivity - tidy up so that
		  						 alarms are not generated for programs
		  						 that are currently showing or have been
		  						 shown
		  20/02/2016 ECU 4.00.08 ShowEPGActivity - more changes to
		  						 determine when the EPG needs refreshing
		  22/02/2016 ECU 4.00.09 TextPreference - tidying up the display
		  						 of stored and value and specify the
		  						 type of text input
		  26/02/2016 ECU 4.00.10 LocationActivity - use tracking details
		  						 in public data to enable tracking to
		  						 file to survive a restart by the Android
		  						 OS. 
		  						 General - add a bluetooth remote 
		  						 controller server
		  27/02/2016 ECU 4.00.11 Remote controller server - implement and
		                         test.
		  28/02/2016 ECU 4.00.12 SystemInfoActivity - tidied up to use
		  						 resources rather than literals
		  29/02/2016 ECU 4.00.13 ShoppingActivity - general tidying up
		  						 to do with the initiali sorting of
		  						 displayed items and checking whether a
		  						 shopping list exists before actioning
		  						 it
		  01/03/2016 ECU 4.00.14 Shopping ... - major changes (similar
		                         to those in the Carer System 31/01/16)
		                         to be able to flag deleted objects and
		                         then to reuse them. This way the indices
		                         will be maintained within the system.
		  03/03/2016 ECU 4.00.15 TVChannel - fixed an indexing error
		  						 GridActivity - put a 'simple' password
		  						 check in if the device is not in
		  						 development mode and the user tries
		  						 to enter the settings activity
		  04/03/2016 ECU 4.00.16 Try and sort out issues caused by an
		  						 alarm being actioned when the app is
		  						 not running - try and start up the
		  						 app automatically.
		  						 TextToSpeechsService - changed from
		  						 using a thread to process phrases
		  						 to a handler
		  05/03/2016 ECU 4.00.17 AlarmActions - remove the use of try/catch
		  						 and try and anticipate if the app is
		  						 running by using information stored in
		  						 'storedData'
		  06/03/2016 ECU 4.00.18 Tidied up issues associated with the
		                         AlarmActions changes. Involved mods in
		                         MainActivity and GridActivity
		                         DialogueUtilities - specify a minimum
		                         value on the sliderChoice and alter
		                         all calls to the new method
		  07/03/2016 ECU 4.00.19 Panic Alarm - changes made to restart
		                         the app if an alarm is received by
		                         AlarmManagerReceiver when the app has
		                         been stopped. Changes made in 
		                         AlarmManagerReceiver and StaticData
		  09/03/2016 ECU 4.00.20 Set the timed medication properly which
		                         involved changes to TimerActivity, 
		                         MedicationActivity and Utilities.
		  11/03/2016 ECU 4.00.21 Add control of the 'vibrate', set the
		                         permissions in this manifest and enable
		                         its set up as an 'action command'
		  16/03/2016 ECU 4.00.22 PanicAlarmActivity - changes to try and
		                         get the alarm into the correct state
		                         when the app is restarted either
		                         manually or by the Android OS - did
		                         lots of testing but concerned that there
		                         may still be some 'timing windows' which
		                         could give errors.
		                         TextToSpeechService - changed to use
		                         the notification builder
		                         DibosonActivity - tidy up screen capture
		                         ActionCommandUtilities and Utilities -
		                         check that the vibrator exists
		  22/03/2016 ECU 4.00.23 Included the handling of the proximity
		                         sensor. Changes in SensorSevice,
		                         Utilities and SettingsActivity 
		  23/03/2016 ECU 4.00.24 SettingsActivity - remove sensor
		  						 information if that sensor does not
		  						 exist on the device 
		  26/03/2016 ECU 4.00.25 Utilities - always use the service
		                         in SpeakAPhrase and create a method
		                         SpeakAPhraseWithDelays to build in a
		                         delay when a full stop is encountered
		  27/03/2016 ECU 4.00.26 DailyScheduler - put in the check so
		                         that if an alarm is received when the
		                         app is not running then it will be started
		                         after having rescheduled the event
		                         causing the call.
		                         StoredData - added alarmsRestartApp
		                         (settable via SettingsActivity) to
		                         optionally leave broadcast receivers
		                         active when the app is destroyed.
		                         AppointmentsActivity - changed to
		                         display a message rather than use toast
		  30/03/2016 ECU 4.00.27 Introduced the use of hashcode's to
		                         try and detect the change of data to
		                         try and overcome a synchronisation
		                         issue (see Notes)
		  03/04/2016 ECU 4.00.28 Some general tidying up of appointments
		                         to prevent the buffering of the associated
		                         reminder alarms when the app is not
		                         running and the 'restart app on alarm'
		                         has not been set.
		  05/04/2016 ECU 4.00.29 Multicast testing because it is used
		                         by a device when the app starts. Am
		                         somewhat concerned that multicasts
		                         seems unreliable 
		  09/04/2016 ECU 4.00.30 Change all references from 'multicast'
		                         to 'broadcast' because in reality
		                         the former was not being used to send
		                         messages to all devices - this was being
		                         done with the broadcast address.
		  16/04/2016 ECU 4.00.31 SystemInfoActivity - because the project
		                         log can be longer (in the number of lines)
		                         than the maximum number of lines in
		                         the TextView then changed to use
		                         Utilities.readLinesFromEndOfFile so the
		                         end of the file is read (or the whole
		                         file if smaller than the display field)  
		  26/04/2016 ECU 4.00.32 Just put in some code so that a device
		                         can monitor another - not in a complete
		                         way but just to receive enough data to
		                         understand what is happening on that device
		  28/04/2016 ECU 4.00.33 Tidy up the monitoring code which is
		                         in ServerThreadForData, MonitorData
		                         and TCPActivity 
		  02/05/2016 ECU 4.00.34 Added TIME action and check if a manual
		  						 email can be sent - not available if
		  						 no network or not set in settings  
		  06/05/2016 ECU 4.00.35 AudioStreamActivity - general tidying
		                         up
		  18/05/2016 ECU 4.00.36 LiquidActivity added and the option
		                         added to GridActivity to automatically
		                         start an activity if the flag set
		                         in the SettingsActivity
		  21/05/2016 ECU 4.00.37 Add user defined 'spoken phrases' to
		                         enhance the voice recognition activity
		  22/05/2016 ECU 4.00.38 TextToSpeechService - modify so that
		                         if music is playing then it will be
		                         paused until the 'utterance' is complete
		                         at which point the music will be resumed
		                         from the point at which it was paused
		  25/05/2016 ECU 4.00.39 VideoRecorder - rewrite so as not to 
		                         use the CameraPreview class.
		  29/05/2016 ECU 4.00.40 Manifest and VideoRecorder - change to
		                         work in portrait mode
		  31/05/2016 ECU 4.00.41 General tidying up of issues to do 
		                         with 'liquid' registration and 
		                         processing - layouts and code.
		  03/06/2016 ECU 4.01.01 Major changes to 'action' handling to
		                         use message handling so that it is
		                         possible to wait for actions to finish
		  08/06/2016 ECU 4.01.02 AudioAnalyser - investigate a problem
		                         with the BACK key which was causing
		                         the activity to hang. Eventually seemed
		                         to be to do with using an AsyncTask
		                         that is in a 'long' loop - changed to
		                         a thread - check the notes in the
		                         activity.
		  12/06/2016 ECU 4.01.03 NFC_Activity - lots of mods to do with
		                         writing NFC tabs and cleaning up the
		                         code
		  13/06/2016 ECU 4.01.04 Changes to the bar code system to enable
		                         'actions' to be associated with a
		                         particular bar code and to enable them
		                         to be processed when a valid bar code
		                         is read.
		  15/06/2016 ECU 4.01.05 NFC_Activity and SereverThreadForData
		                         - provide facility for routing actions
		                         to a remote device for processing
		  17/06/2016 ECU 4.01.06 NFC_Activity - check that remote device
		                         can be communicated with before setting
		                         it as the remote processor
		  23/06/2016 ECU 4.01.07 With the closure of the Radio Times
		                         XMLTV service (provided by Metabroadcast)
		                         the code has to be changed to use the
		                         data supplied in JSON format from
		                         Metabroadcast's atlas system
		                         
		                         24/06/2016 ECU more tidying up
		  24/06/2016 ECU 4.01.08 TV EPG - got a version working using
		                         JSON instead of XMLTV
		  27/06/2016 ECU 4.01.09 TV EPG - lots more tidying up and error
		                         handling
		  28/06/2016 ECU 4.01.10 TV EPG - provide the facility, by long
		                         clicking the 'search button' to select
		                         a particular TV channel is to be 
		                         displayed
		  05/07/2016 ECU 4.01.11 TV EPG - have been investigating the
		                         fault detailed in the KnownBugs file
		                         and seem to have resolved it. Important
		                         that the KnownBugs file is read.
		                         
		                         05/07/2016 ECU modified the actions_
		                                        preference layout for
		                                        scrolling - problem on
		                                        the Samsung Tablet
		  06/07/2016 ECU 4.01.12 TV EPG - put in a 'timer' button to
		                         show any 'outstanding' alarms
		  09/07/2016 ECU 4.01.13 TV EPG - make the MetaBroadcast 
		                         parameters configurable through the
		                         normal settings activity.
		  13/07/2016 ECU 4.01.14 Notifications - put in a local notification
		                         mechanism
		  21/07/2016 ECU 4.01.15 EPG - made changes to interface to
		                         the Schedules Direct system
		  22/07/2016 ECU 4.01.16 EPG - major tidying up of the Schedules
		                         Direct code
		  24/07/2016 ECU 4.01.17 More tidying up of known issues
		  28/07/2016 ECU 4.01.18 Marshmallow - started looking at the
		                         the changes prior to using it as the
		                         development environment. Main areas
		                          1) returns fake MAC address (02:00:00:00:00:00)
		                             so get via another means
		                          2) the 'setLatestEventInfo' no longer
		                             exists in Notification so change
		                             the code (TimerService and ServerService)
		                             to use NotificationCompat.Builder
		                          3) the Apache HTTP classes have been
		                             removed so either rewrite the code
		                             or add the Apache library as a 
		                             dependency - will do the later
		                         At the moment leave with Lollipop 
		  29/07/2016 ECU 4.01.19 Changed to use Marshmallow and set
		                         Apache as a dependency
		  04/08/2016 ECU 4.01.20 NamedActions (started on 02/08 and
		                         03/08) implemented the code and test
		  15/08/2016 ECU 4.01.21 Selector - changed to use onBackPressed
		                         rather than onKeyDown (notes in the
		                         class)
		  20/08/2016 ECU 4.01.22 AudioRecorder - general tidying up
		  07/09/2016 ECU 4.01.23 UPnP_Activity - created to play around
		                         with cybergarage
		  20/09/2016 ECU 4.01.24 General tidying up
		  13/09/2016 ECU 4.01.25 More tidying up and investing any 
		                         remaining errors
		  05/10/2016 ECU 4.01.26 Seattle trip - changes to carer handling
		                         mainly
		  11/10/2016 ECU 4.01.27 Lots of tidying up with Groups and
		                         Appointments
		  18/10/2016 ECU 4.01.28 Documents activity added
		  23/10/2016 ECU 4.01.29 Appointments - add recorded notes
		  27/10/2016 ECU 4.01.30 Start looking at different locales
		                         eg. US versus GB - date format
		  31/10/2016 ECU 4.01.31 AppointmentsActivity - major tidy up
		                         to put some of the data into resources
		                         rather than being held locally
		  01/11/2016 ECU 4.01.32 General tidying up of the buttons used
		                         in selector row layout
		                           use button_height / width 
		                            instead of 40dp / 80dp
		                           and shape of row_button
		                            instead of button_shape 
		  03/11/2016 ECU 4.01.33 1) create an alarmManager in PublicData
		                            and remove all local managers that
		                            used to be local
		                         2) when cancelling an alarm then
		                            also, optionally, cancel the pending 
		                            intent (see Utilities.cancelAnAlarm)
		  09/11/2016 ECU 4.01.34 Because of the change in the handling
		                         of runtime permissions that came in at
		                         API 23 (Marshmallow) was necessary to
		                         check for the required permissions
		                         (via the RuntimePermissions class)
		                         and prompt the user to ensure that
		                         the permissions set via the 'Settings'
		                         app, and the 'Apps' option is correct. 
		  11/11/2016 ECU 4.01.35 Did a rewrite of the network discovery
		                         - i.e. the code in DiscoverActivity
		                         and DiscoverThread  
		  12/11/2016 ECU 4.01.36 DialogueUtilities - add method for getting
		                         a valid IP address  
		  14/11/2016 ECU 4.01.37 AudioRecorder - do a rewrite to use
		                         random access files rather than a
		                         temporary file  
		  18/11/2016 ECU 4.01.38 AudioAnalyser - tidy up because there
		                         was a scaling error in DibosonView
		                         which was highlighted when using Android
		                         6 devices
		  20/11/2016 ECU 4.01.39 AudioAnalyser and DibosonView - changed
		                         to use a 'handler' rather than threads
		                         to clean the code and make it easier
		                         to understand 
		  24/11/2016 ECU 4.01.40 Investigating some issues with bluetooth
		                         discovery when used for changing the
		                         status of carers when they arrive/depart.
		                         A few problems were detected mainly due
		                         to tasks trying to access the screen when
		                         they are not on the UI - hopefully these
		                         have been resolved.  
		  27/11/2016 ECU 4.01.41 CarerActivity highlighted a clash 
		                         between MessageHandler and TextToSpeech
		                         service - notes are in the classes.
		                         Also tidied up the bluetooth versus
		                         manual notification of visits. 
		  28/11/2016 ECU 4.01.42 Utilities.SetUpActivity tidied up
		                         and went through all activities to
		                         set up the screen because on the Sony XA
		                         the status bar was always being shown 
		  29/11/2016 ECU 4.01.43 AppointmentsActivity - change to have
		                         a true 'display only' mode. Changed
		                         GridActivity so that this is displayed
		                         when the item selected - a long press
		                         is required to enter the edit / add
		                         mode 
		  07/12/2016 ECU 4.01.44 Tidied up the Care visits so that the
		                         list of 'tasks to do' can be edited 
		  08/12/2016 ECU 4.01.45 Care visits - more checking of the
		                         associated alarms and survival over
		                         a restart of the app 
		  11/12/2016 ECU 4.01.46 MedicationActivity - provide the facility
		                         to email medication details sorted by
		                         day of dose or by the medication itself  
		             ECU 4.01.47 MainActivity - created SetVariablesFromResources
		                         and tidied up the way 'day of the week'
		                         is handled  
		  14/12/2016 ECU 4.01.48 Tidy up some of the cloning and file
		                         transfer methods  
		  18/12/2016 ECU 4.01.49 GameTwo - provide a facility to change
		                         the background using the mew
		                         Utilities.scaleBitmap method
		  22/12/2016 ECU 4.01.50 DibosonActivity - decide whether
		                         changing testing notes or capturing the
		                         screen by displaying a yes/no dialogue.
		                         General tidying up.  
		  23/12/2016 ECU 4.01.51 DisplayDrawableActivity - changed from

		                         when the torch is on
		                         Moved all of the flashlight methods
		                         from Utilities into a new FlashLight
		                         class.
		  30/12/2016 ECU 4.01.53 GridActivity - add 'long press' on
		                         torch to do delayed operations
		  31/12/2016 ECU 4.01.54 UserInterface added to try and tidy up
		                         the way the displayed details of an
		                         activity, in the user interface, are
		                         displayed
		  01/01/2017 ECU 4.01.55 GridActivity - change ImageAdapter to
		                         be more of a customised form so that
		                         text can be displayed
		  21/01/2017 ECU 4.01.56 ShowEPGActivity and MessageHandler -
		                         add display of current date/time on
		                         the currently selected tab
		  22/01/2017 ECU 4.01.57 ShowEPGActivity - make sure the display
		                         of selected TV programs is maintained

		                         flag to 'restart app on timer' is set
		  31/01/2017 ECU 4.01.61 MessageHandler and Utilities - change
		                         the way that a drawable is displayed
		                         so that it uses Toast rather than an
		                         activity. Use this when giving warnings
		                         about the light level.

		  02/03/2017 ECU 4.01.72 DailySummaryActivity - tidy up with
		                         better layouts. Add shared preference
		                         handling within MainActivity to check
		                         if the app is already running
		  04/03/2017 ECU 4.01.73 Alarm problem (see KnownBugs file) -
		                         change AlarmService to AlarmReceiver
		                         because NOT a service
	      05/03/2017 ECU 4.01.74 Have a general tidy up up- remove all
	                             calls to TestLogUtilities.Log. Did more
	                             testing of the Alarm problem but the
	                             issue still remains.
	      06/03/2017 ECU 4.01.75 SchedulesDirect - a problem was highlighted
	                             yesterday which meant that the encoding
	                             of incoming data was not being handled
	                             correctly - this has been corrected.
	      10/03/2017 ECU 4.01.76 WebUtilities - store some of the HTML
	                             files in 'raw' so that a meaningful 
	                             web server can work if there are no pages
	                             in 'htdocs'.
	                             SpeakingClock - added Westminster chimes
	                             which are stored as 'raw' resources

    	03/11/2015 ECU added the theme line to avoid a blank white
                       screen being displayed when the app is run
        12/01/2016 ECU added largeHeap option
        31/01/2016 ECU added the launchMode option - singleTask
              Notes from Android documentation
              ================================
              The "singleTask" and "singleInstance" modes also differ 
              from each other in only one respect: A "singleTask" 
              activity allows other activities to be part of its task. 
              It's always at the root of its task, but other activities 
              (necessarily "standard" and "singleTop" activities) can 
              be launched into that task. A "singleInstance" activity, 
              on the other hand, permits no other activities to be
              part of its task. It's the only activity in the task.
              If it starts another activity, that activity is 
              assigned to a different task — as if FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK 
              was in the intent.

        	 23/02/2016 ECU added the theme to try and make the display
        	                more readable.
        	 24/03/2016 ECU played around with the theme but does not
        	                look correct for some of the dialogues where
        	                am getting a black background so decided to
        	                remove it until it is understood better
        	  			ECU put the theme back because put a 'bodge' in
        	  			    the multiline_input layout (commented there)              
        	                to try and remove some black background
